## The Kuicklist WP Plugin Lets You Take Your Checklists With You =
Speaking of Wordpress, there was no way we could not have an option for this.

So we’ve created our own plugin that lets you serve up any checklist you want inside your Kuicklist account.

Just download and install the plugin, select where you want to show your checklist on your Wordpress site and voila!

You’ve got an instant page or post ready to capture tons of leads.

Note: You will need an active KuickList account to use this plugin. This plugin uses your KuickList account API key to perform the actions on behalf of you. e.g; Fetches your checklists from your account.

## Fully Customizable Checklist Design =
Kuicklist will give you multiple sections per checklist that you can use to wow your subscribers and visitors.

Everything you need to dazzle your audience is already included.

Just click a section to edit and you can make checklists until your heart’s content. Choose your colors, add sections, and more.

## All Your Checklists Are Mobile Responsive =
Because you’ll have multiple ways you can share your checklists, we’ve made sure that every single one is mobile responsive.

Doesn’t matter if it’s being viewed on a computer monitor or a mobile phone.

Your checklists will show correctly every single time.

## Quickstart Checklists To Remove The Guesswork =
Hey, we get it. Even as awesome as Kuicklist is... you still might need a little inspiration to get you going.

That’s why when you create your checklist, they will be filled with predefined templates to help you get off to a running start.

Just click, edit, save, and you’ve got a checklist ready for the masses.

## Iframe Embedding Lets You Put Your Checklists Where You Want =
Maybe there’s a place online that you want to display your checklist that allows for html code?

This option is perfect because you tap into multiple sources of traffic by using an iframe embed anywhere online that allows for it.

Also great if you have other content that aren’t named Wordpress.
